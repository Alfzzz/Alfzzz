## Projects I've worked on.

  - Autonomous System development for MIT-designed RACECAR(Rapid Autonomous Complex Environment Competing Ackermann steeRing) using ROS, OpenCV and multiple sensors.
  - 4 digit number calculator(addition, substraction, multiplication and division) based on visual logic circuits editing on FPGA Altera Cyclone III.
  - Figure changing and showing on a computer screen usinG VGA and controlled by keyboard using UART, written in VHDL on FPGA Altera Cyclone IV.
  - CAN protocol communication between an Arduino UNO, a STM32 Nucleo L496ZG-P and a Jetson AGX Xavier.  
  - Door lock security System on a Raspberry Pi4 using multiple sensors and facial recognition.
